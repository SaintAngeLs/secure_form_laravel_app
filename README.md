# Secure Form Laravel Application

## Overview

The **Secure Form Laravel Application** is a hybrid modular monolith built with **Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles. This application allows users to submit forms and upload files in a secure and efficient manner. It features a robust backend built with Laravel, a frontend with responsive design, and support for integrations with AWS S3 for file storage.

## Key Features

- **File Upload**: Securely upload files and retrieve them using file metadata.
- **Form Submission**: Users can submit detailed forms that are stored and accessible for future reference.
- **Pagination & Search**: Provides paginated lists of form entries with search functionality.
- **Swagger Documentation**: API documentation using Swagger UI.
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns between domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation layers.
- **Modular Design**: Organized codebase with reusable and testable modules.
- **Docker Support**: Simplified local development with Docker containers.

## How to Run the Project Locally

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For containerized application setup.
- **Node.js** (Optional): Required for frontend development.
- **PHP 8.2** (Optional): If running outside Docker.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaintAngeLs/secure_form_laravel_app.git
   cd secure_form_laravel_app
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Copy the provided `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure your local environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install and build js dependencies:
   ```bash
   nvm use 18 # at least 18 v.
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Start the Containers**:
   Run the following command to build and start the containers within the services of microinfrastructure performing artisan commands (migration and seeding):
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   - **Frontend**: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
    > **Note**: You can register users using **Laravel Breeze** or use the pre-seeded test user:
    > - **Email**: `test@example.com`
    > - **Password**: `testtest`

   - **API Documentation**: [http://localhost:9090/api/documentation](http://localhost:9090/api/documentation)

   - **Kafka**: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
   - **gAdmin**: [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050)
